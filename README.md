# fashion_MNIST_CNN_model
This repository contains the CNN models which are used to conquer the fashion_MINST dataset. The models used here are lenet and resnet18

We have used open vino optimzation for the lenet model and used intel_extension_for_pytorch for resnet18 model to show which model is better and which optimization is better.

The results are then visualized in graphical formats using matplotlib.

the report and results are given in docs section of the repository, incase if it dosen't work
