# fahsion_MNIST_CNN_model
This repository contains the CNN models which are used to conquer the fashion_MINST dataset. The models used here are lenet and resnet18

We have used open vino optimzation for the lenet model and used intel_extension_for_pytorch for resnet18 model to show which model is better and which optimization is better
